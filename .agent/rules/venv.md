# Virtual Environment Policy

Always operate within the project's virtual environment.

1.  **Executable Paths:** Use the direct paths to executables in `venv/bin/` (e.g., `./venv/bin/python`, `./venv/bin/pytest`, `./venv/bin/pip`).
2.  **Activation:** If running a sequence of shell commands, activate the environment first: `source venv/bin/activate`.
3.  **Dependencies:** Ensure all dependencies are installed in the virtual environment.
