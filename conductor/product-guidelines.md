# Product Guidelines

## Dashboard & Reporting Principles

### 1. Voice and Tone
- **Business-Centric & Authoritative:** All communications, especially the Executive Dashboard and Compliance Reports, must use clear, high-level summaries.
- Prioritize ROI, strategic impact, and regulatory safety over purely technical metrics.
- Technical details should be available but framed within their business significance (e.g., "Latency reduction improving Customer NPS" rather than just "ms reduction").

### 2. Presentation of Savings & ROI
- **Ranked by ROI:** Optimization opportunities must always be listed starting with the highest potential savings to drive immediate focus on "quick wins."
- **Side-by-Side Comparison:** Every recommendation must show a "Current State" vs. "Optimized State" comparison to make the value proposition undeniable.
- **Annual Extrapolation:** Savings figures should be extrapolated to a 12-month period (e.g., ₹15-25L) to align with long-term strategic and financial planning.

### 3. Visual Design Standards
- **Executive Clarity (Insight-First):** The dashboard must highlight 3-5 "North Star" metrics (e.g., Total Waste, Savings Potential, Compliance Score) for immediate understanding.
- **Regulatory Rigor (RAG Status):** Use Red-Amber-Green (RAG) indicators mapped directly to RBI FREE-AI compliance points to signal risk and urgency.
- **Developer Transparency:** Provide drill-down capabilities for every chart and metric, allowing technical teams to audit the underlying logs and calculation logic to maintain high trust.

### 4. Implementation Guidelines (MVP Focus)
- **Data Integrity:** Cost calculations must be based on the latest documented pricing from providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS) and updated regularly.
- **Privacy-First:** Ensure that logs used for cost attribution do not capture or store sensitive PII/PHI in compliance with BFSI and Healthcare standards.
- **Actionable Outputs:** Every identified gap or inefficiency must be accompanied by a concrete "Next Step" or "Recommendation" block.
- **Speed to Value:** Prioritize the functionality that delivers the "5 Ranked Optimization Opportunities" and "Executive Dashboard" over complex, nice-to-have features.
